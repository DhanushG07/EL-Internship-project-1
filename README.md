 **HR Analytics**: Predicting Employee Attrition

## Project Overview

This project explores an HR dataset from IBM to understand the key drivers of employee attrition. The goal is to identify which employees are most likely to leave the company and why, using data science techniques.


##  Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand attrition patterns
- Build a classification model to predict employee attrition
- Use SHAP values to explain the model's predictions
- Visualize attrition trends using Power BI


## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP)
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- Dataset: `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` from IBM HR Analytics


## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and categorical encoding
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed attrition trends by department, age, gender, and income
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression classifier
   - Confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation
4. **Model Explainability**
   - Used SHAP to interpret feature importance
5. **Visualization**
   - Power BI dashboard with filters for department, age group, and income


## Key Insights

- Younger employees (18â€“30) had the highest attrition rate
- Sales Representatives and Lab Technicians showed more attrition
- Employees with low income and single marital status were more likely to leave


## Final Deliverables

- `HR_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix`: Interactive report
- `Attrition_Report.pdf`: Project summary report
- `shap_summary.png`: SHAP visualization
